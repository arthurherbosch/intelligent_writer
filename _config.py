    The versatility of natural gas is one key to its expected prominent role in the energy transition, serving as an energy source for all sectors including heating, cooking and industrial applications. When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, natural gas has a significant advantage over coal, emitting about half the CO2.  This makes it an attractive option for stabilizing the path to renewables while reducing carbon emissions in the short term.  1. Natural gas is a reliable, affordable energy source which enables innovation   The impact of the COVID pandemic as well as of recent extreme weather events has drawn attention to the systemic risks that impact energy security.    In many countries, nuclear power is being phased out or shelved, creating additional need for other technologies to provide a reliable baseload. Natural gas, as an easy to store, lower-carbon option, stands out as a good candidate to provide an uninterrupted, flexible energy supply in tandem with intermittent output from wind and solar while storage technologies are scaled up and innovative new energy pathways are explored.  In a 2019 report, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) said that the ability of natural gas to provide a relatively low carbon backup at peak energy usage times, rather than play a traditional role of round-the-clock baseload, may prove to be its greatest contribution to the energy transition.   

2. It acts as a bridging ingredient in the hydrogen revolution  

Natural gas is also frequently cited as a driver of the energy transition because of its central role in the scaling up (production and transport) of hydrogen – which the European Union, among others, has predicted will play a key role in a future climate-neutral economy.   


The EU’s hydrogen policy notes that although the cost of producing ‘clean hydrogen’ (made entirely using renewable electricity) is falling, it remains comparatively high. The EU strategy envisions the development of ‘clean hydrogen’ as a gradual trajectory, initially including ‘hydrogen’ from natural gas.  

3. It is a key tool in the fight against energy poverty  

Although great progress has been made in ensuring access to electricity globally, in the Global South, over 700 million people remain cut off from electric power and clean cooking technologies. Almost 600 million of them live in Africa – and the continent accounts for less than 4 percent of annual global carbon emissions. Although renewable energy capacity is expanding rapidly, the technology faces challenges. For example, Kenya, which is home to the continent’s largest wind farm, is achieving only around 15 percent of installed capacity from wind and solar.    

Natural gas is a plentiful and valuable resource for countries from Algeria and Egypt to Ghana, Senegal and Mozambique. According to a report by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the continent’s traditional reliance on biomass, coal and oil means that a combination of renewables and other cleaner fuels such as natural gas is important in fast-tracking the energy transition.  

4. Along with Carbon Capture and Storage, it can transform the energy sector    

In the short to medium term, and in conjunction with renewables and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), new natural gas developments can complement the decarbonization of the energy sector.  

According to the UNECE report, carbon capture, use and storage offers a real prospect for natural gas to work with renewable energy sources on decarbonization. In particular, it helps to address the problem of how to cope with hard-to-abate emissions from heavy industry, notably steel, cement and petrochemicals.  

Scaling up of CCUS will be critical, given the scale and urgency of the decarbonization challenge – not only with respect to electricity generation, but also heating. An IHS Markit study illustrates how far the world is from electrification of heating – for instance, New York City’s power system has 31GW total capacity, but would require 150GW capacity to electrify heating (133GW, with full deployment of heat pumps). Natural gas is unlikely, then, to be phased out in the near term, but will continue to play a role in the hydrogen production, in combination with accelerated deployment of CCUS until hydrogen produced from renewables or nuclear is economically viable as a fuel for heating.   


Natural gas can contribute to climate targets, and serves as a bridge to overcome technology gaps.  

In a report published earlier this year, the G20 observed that natural gas meets a considerable share of seasonal energy demand in many countries, offering resilience and security of supply in the face of adverse weather and volatile markets. In addition to this short-term role, the group suggested that an extensive roll-out of CCUS technology and hydrogen production in the longer term would enable natural gas to align with a net-zero pathway.

Examples: 

1. Transport. Transportation accounts for ~16% of global CO2 emissions, and carbon-positive solutions in the sector are therefore critical for global decarbonization. Low-carbon solutions will be especially needed in the transportation for hard-to-convert sectors where electrification is not an easy immediate prospect — for example shipping and aviation.  Early adopters will have both financial and regulatory incentives to move early.

Examples of low-carbon transport fuel include:
— blue hydrogen (made from natural gas)
— biofuels

{"role": "assistant", "content": """The long road to net zero 

There is a gulf between where the world is today and where it needs to be to hit net zero by 2050. Carbon-intensive coal, which is still the leading source of energy, is releasing record levels of carbon dioxide and renewable sources still only produce a relatively small proportion of our energy needs. 

The coming decades represent a transitional period, as renewable energy solutions are scaled up to displace fossil fuel consumption. During this transition, there is ample opportunity to increase energy stability by replacing the most carbon-intensive fuels with lower- and low-carbon fuels until alternatives can fulfil all our energy needs. 

Making the switch to lower-carbon power generation has already produced results in some countries. In the US, CO2 emissions from generating electricity fell by 32% between 2005 and 2019, largely the result of a shift from coal to natural gas, which produces significantly less carbon dioxide.  In the coming years, there is an opportunity to go further by introducing low-carbon fuels in multiple sectors, especially those that are challenging to electrify. Some of these fuels are available already, including sustainable aviation fuels and biofuels for transportation, while others are being developed. These include lower-carbon hydrogen (produced from natural gas and supported by carbon capture, utilization and storage), and hydrogen produced from renewable energy. 

Renewables rising 

The transition to net zero presents a vast challenge that will be tackled in diverse ways by different countries. The pathways are complicated by ever-growing demand for electricity and will be influenced by geopolitics along the way. Ensuring a just and orderly transition means that – for all the urgency of climate change – it is impossible to displace fossil fuels overnight. Not only do renewables provide just 29 percent of our electricity needs globally, but the fastest-growing renewables, wind and solar, require technologies like grid-scale energy storage to manage intermittency – and some industries’ needs can only be met by fossil fuels at present. 

Steelmaking, for example, is considered a hard-to-abate sector due to the extremely high temperatures necessary that can only be reached by burning fuel. However, analyses suggest that the industry could reach net zero by 2050 with a combination of carbon capture, low-carbon fuels and more efficient steel use. In the short- to medium-term, low-carbon fuels present our best opportunity to press ahead with decarbonizing such hard-to-abate industries. 

Complementary fuels 

Switching to lower-carbon fuels is among the most economically, politically, and technologically feasible approaches to slowing carbon emissions. It offers a lower-carbon future for newly built infrastructure in East and Southeast Asia, which could otherwise become stranded assets with serious socio-economic consequences.  

According to the IEA, co-firing of ammonia and hydrogen has been successfully demonstrated at power plants. Increased use of low-carbon fuels in the power sector could help establish supply chains and drive down costs, encouraging uptake in other sectors. 

Transport – which accounts for one fifth (21%) of global CO2 emissions – is another sector well-positioned for fuel-switching. While full electrification is the ultimate goal for transport, this is not feasible in the short-term, particularly in countries that struggle to produce enough electricity and for long-distance journeys and heavy vehicles (e.g.: ships, aircraft, and trucks) that require fuels with high energy density. Vehicles of all types, however, can run on lower-carbon fuels such as biofuels, compressed natural gas, and liquid natural gas (either on their own or blended with fossil fuels) with minimal adjustments. Natural gas can emit 25 percent less carbon per unit of energy compared with conventional gasoline. 

Despite the relative ease with which the switch to lower-carbon fuels can be made, this opportunity remains largely unseized. Encouraging a switch to these fuels, which are a more expensive option, is likely to require government interventions in the short- to medium-term. 

The road to net zero is long and scattered with obstacles. For many sectors, switching to low-carbon fuels can provide the stable, progressive transition to lower emissions that the world needs.

{"role": "assistant", "content": """
When we talk about the challenge of decarbonization, we tend to think of electricity production – but there are other fossil fuel-dependent industries that are just as essential to everyday life. In fact, around 30 percent of global energy is consumed by the agricultural and food sector.  

A report from UN Food and Agriculture Organization experts found that food systems emitted 18Gt of CO2 equivalent in 2015 – 34 percent of overall emissions – and these emissions are continuing to grow. 

The cost of crop production 

The rise of ammonia-based fertilizers has hugely boosted crop production, doubling the number of people that a unit of land can feed and sustaining the growing global population. 

However, producing ammonia is an energy-intensive process that uses fossil fuels, both as the source of hydrogen and as an energy source. Commercial ammonia production accounts for almost two percent of global energy consumption.  Although it is possible to produce ‘green ammonia’ from water and renewable energy, in practice almost all ammonia is derived from fossil fuels. 

Carbon-intensive value chains 

Fertilizer production is just one of the many ways in which food production contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. 

For instance, research published in Science estimated that livestock and fisheries account for 31 percent of food-related emissions, land use (mainly the conversion of forests and other ‘carbon sinks’ into cropland or pasture) for 24 percent, and supply chains for 18 per cent. Small but significant contributions came from packaging, transportation and refrigeration. 

Cutting emissions, then, is no straightforward task – particularly while food demand continues to grow. The reality is there is no silver bullet. A combination of approaches is needed to tackle the many sources of emissions: changes to land use, shifts in consumer behavior, shortened supply chains, efficiency measures, and alternatives to fertilizers made with fossil fuels. 

Food that doesn’t cost the earth 

Green ammonia could play a significant role in reducing use of fossil fuels in food production. With the cost of renewables falling compared with fossil fuels, green ammonia is inching closer to commercial viability. Several large ammonia producers have announced projects to produce green ammonia, including Yara, which is carrying out pilot projects in Norway, the Netherlands and Australia. 

In the meantime, there could be ways to reduce fertilizer use. In fact, it has been pointed out that many policies and regulations inadvertently encourage excessive fertilizer use. The European Commission is working to increase the sustainability of food systems, with an aim of cutting fertilizer use by a fifth by 2030. This could be considered a first step towards ‘precision agriculture’, in which data is used to inform how to use fertilizer, fuel and other resources more effectively, reducing waste, costs and emissions.  

The energy transition is not just about electricity and heating – fossil fuels are used in the production of all sorts of indispensable resources. Rising to the climate challenge calls for changes to how we produce, process, and consume food.

Increasing the scale of carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technology is essential if we are to keep global warming to within 2°C. However, despite the technology having been around for several decades, its potential has yet to be fully realized.  

Significant investment is required to scale up deployment of CCUS technology if we are to reach net-zero targets, potentially amounting to trillions of dollars. Despite these challenges, there is renewed momentum around CCUS projects. 

[Embed this carousel: https://twitter.com/IEF_Dialogue/status/1596061135828049922]  

From stagnation to renewed energy 

Following early growth in the 1980s, interest in CCUS as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change peaked during the 2000s. However, by 2010, only slightly more than 15 MtCO2 was being captured, and the following decade saw the mass cancellation of CCUS project plans.    

One of the biggest roadblocks was the lack of investment and political will to support the development and deployment of the technology. Less than 0.5% of clean energy and efficiency technologies investments go towards CCUS, according to the IEA, and a lack of policy support negatively impacts the commercial appeal of CCUS.

Today, the situation is changing, with several factors driving this new momentum, including the 2023 UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which said carbon capture could be necessary to reach net-zero goals, especially in hard-to-abate industries. 

Policy changes and strategic vision drive CCUS investment impetus 

Part of this impetus is due to policy changes that favor climate mitigation technologies, with the United States and Europe leading the way. A section of the US tax code, 45Q, provides a tax credit for carbon sequestration. This is designed to incentivize a variety of projects under CCUS. The expansion of 45Q  in 2018 kickstarted renewed interest in CCUS and in 2021 more than 100 new CCUS facilities were announced around the world. In 2022, the US Inflation Reduction Act further expanded and extended the 45Q tax credit by increasing the credit amount and lowering the CO2 capture capacity bar for eligibility, which is expected to act as a stimulus for investment in CCUS projects. 

The EU has also announced an upcoming strategic vision for CCUS technologies. The plan includes a €3 billion package for investment in CCUS innovation and development and the creation of an EU-wide carbon storage infrastructure. Member states are increasing their own support, with Denmark allocating €5 billion euro to CCUS projects.  

Elon Musk’s launch of the $100M XPRIZE for carbon removal in January 2021 shows that private investment can also be an important factor in driving CCUS development.  

Innovation drives new technologies for load sharing, storage and use 

One of the most promising opportunities is the creation of industrial ‘hubs’, which capture CO2 from associated facilities, sharing CO2 transport and storage infrastructure. Examples include the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line and Norway’s Longship Project, which includes the Northern Lights offshore storage hub.  

Innovative new approaches to carbon capture and storage are opening up further avenues for CCUS and creating potential for a circular carbon economy. These include direct air capture (DAC) of CO2, the potential for ocean carbon capture as well as the production of carbon-negative concrete. Nature-based solutions, such as afforestation and restorative or regenerative farming, are also gaining traction as an essential part of carbon management.

De-risking CCUS investment 

Despite these developments, there are still many challenges to be overcome if CCUS is to be scaled up “from the mega to the giga” to reach 5.6 Gt CO2 capacity by 2050 to meet Paris goals.  

The cost of the technology remains extremely high. Energy penalties also pose a barrier, along with the lack of regulatory frameworks in place to support the widespread development and deployment of CCUS. 

There are concerns about the safety of storing CO2 underground and some critics view CCUS as a vehicle for prolonging the role of fossil fuels in the global economy, as opposed to a clean energy technology. 

However, these challenges are not insurmountable. To de-risk CCUS investment, there are several ways to increase investor confidence: 

Developing a clear and consistent regulatory framework across countries and enforcing regulations that address CCUS liability issues 

Creating a stable and predictable market for CCUS technology that aligns with Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards  

Ramping up research and development to reduce the cost of CCUS technology 

Widening public awareness 

Exploring new financing models such as creative incentivization programs, public-private partnerships and green bonds, to increase access to capital markets for CCUS projects 

Creating network synergies with hydrogen infrastructure to make CCUS projects more cost-effective 

With the right support and investment, CCUS technology will become a more attractive investment opportunity, accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy as an important tool in the fight against climate change. """},

The article would break down the need for employers to comply with legislation as well as going above and beyond to support people, eg with budgets for fans for at home workers, flexible schedules to let people avoid peak temperatures."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": """
     The recent heat waves across much of Europe have caused considerable disruption (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/17/forest-fires-rage-across-europe-as-heatwave-sends-temperatures-soaring), not least to the workplace. As temperatures continue to rise, research (https://www.newscientist.com/article/2326163-every-heatwave-occurring-today-is-more-intense-due-to-climate-change/) suggests that these heat waves are going to increase in both frequency and severity. With this in mind, here are some tips to ensure that your workplace remains a safe and comfortable environment for your employees when the mercury rises.

	1. Allow for flexibility
Employers can take steps to ensure the safety and comfort of their workers by allowing for increased flexibility. Those working outside or in already warm places like kitchens and foundries are particularly at risk, so changing shift times to avoid the hottest periods of the day can provide a welcome respite from the heat. 

Companies should also take into account the differing needs of a workforce, making sure that people with a disability or health condition (https://www.cipd.co.uk/about/media/press/110722-cipd-keeping-employees-cool-heatwave#gref), for example, feel safe, comfortable and supported in the working environment. (https://www.adeccogroup.com/future-of-work/latest-insights/disability-advocates-explain-what-truly-make-companies-inclusive/) 

2. Ensure the workplace is as cool as possible
A major UK insurance company (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-18/apartments-in-former-office-buildings-ill-suited-to-extreme-heat) recently warned that glass curtain walls and floor-to-ceiling windows, while popular for office buildings, are notably poor at keeping out heat, and can create kiln-like conditions. 

It is vital to ensure that a place of work is comfortable enough for people to focus on the job at hand. Ensuring that air conditioning is installed and functioning is a great place to start, but other measures such as turning off heat-emitting appliances like printers and large screens can also reduce the temperature. 

Employers could conduct a heat risk assessment to reflect on how safe and conducive their offices are. 

3. Consider those working from home
Check-in regularly with those working from home (https://www.adeccogroup.com/en-ch/future-of-work/insights/remote-work/) to ensure that they are coping. Many houses and apartments are ill-equipped to deal with the heat, so if possible try to make some funds available for employees to purchase or rent cooling measures like fans or air conditioning units. Something that is a relatively small financial cost for a business could make a huge difference when it comes to both wellbeing and productivity. 

Those working from home should ultimately have the same level of provision and care as those working in the office. Staff shouldn't be coming in to the office just to get access to the air conditioning!

4. Rethink your dress code
Trade unions have recently been making headlines in light of the blistering heatwaves demanding more flexibility with regards to work attire. Why not anticipate the needs of staff and get ahead of their requests? If your industry requires a formal dress code then consider whether it would be possible to relax it when the temperature exceeds a certain level. Likewise, if uniform or protective equipment (https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/17/working-in-a-heatwave-your-rights-in-the-uk-and-how-to-prepare) must be worn then think about the impact that this may have on an employee and consider whether alternatives are possible.

5. Stay up to date on legislation
Governments have varying legislation on working limits during extreme weather, so ensure that you are fully aware of any mandatory changes in hours or working provisions – and at which temperatures they apply. The recent heat wave has already brought about legislation changes, most notably in Madrid where unions demanded a maximum working temperature (https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2022/07/25/trade-unions-call-for-maximum-working-temperature-cap-after-eu-heatwave-deaths_5991324_114.html) of 39C for manual street cleaners following the death of a worker.

Many other jurisdictions across Europe are now expected to follow suit, however if you think the temperature or conditions may put your employees at risk (https://www.adeccogroup.com/future-of-work/latest-insights/the-dangerous-effects-of-overworking/) then do not wait for legislation to make alterations.

AT LAST - WORLDWIDE VALIDATION FOR THE CHIEF DIVERSITY OFFICER 

Sometimes it takes a global pandemic to sort out a problem. Chief Diversity Officers (CDOs) around the planet might agree. 

The diversity officer's raison d'être is to advance the core values of diversity and inclusion in their company. Seen for some years by cynics as little more than a box-ticking exercise, the often under-supported and misunderstood CDO now has a folder full of inspiring stats, thanks to the world-changing events of the past three years.

Back in 2019 the career ladder was uneven, unstable and, for some, pretty much unscalable. Here in 2022, there's been at least some progress in making its rungs easier to grasp, allowing companies to reap the well-documented benefits of a more diverse workforce.

No workplace like home? 

What all the seminars, workshops and equal opportunities pledges were struggling to achieve may just have been turbocharged with the combination of a traumatic pandemic and tech.

Pre-pandemic, Silicon companies like Facebook were renowned for their tasty workplace extras - offering everything from award-winning chefs in the staff restaurant, games rooms and gyms to tree-house break-out zones and meditation pods. 

Today, there may be no need to skateboard over to the brainstorm room. Meta’s 2022 diversity report (https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/metas-diversity-report-2022/) states that around 75% of its teams are now working across multiple locations.

“For the first time,” says Meta, “we’re hiring individuals who are fully remote and working from locations where we don’t have offices.”

As a result Meta has found its hiring pool suddenly much, much larger. With unprecedented access to talent around the globe, it’s been much better able to accelerate its diversity quota. It has doubled its hire rate on two key targets - Black and Hispanic employees in the US, and women around the globe. 

People with disabilities now make up 6.2% of the workforce, up from 4.7% in 2021. Along with 2.3% veterans and 10% LGBTQ+ identifiers, these figures seem to back up Meta’s statement that underrepresented people now make up 46.7% of its staff.

Remote works

Remote hiring has to be a key factor in this. Research by Future Forum in 2021 (https://futureforum.com/2021/03/11/dismantling-the-office-moving-from-retrofit-to-redesign/) found that Black employees strongly prefer a remote or hybrid model of working. A staggering 97% of them, in fact. In the US only 3% wished to return to full-time in-person work, compared to 21% of white workers.

In 2021 the UK government called for a national shift in favour of remote, hybrid and flexible working (https://www.gov.uk/flexible-working), after its Behavioural Insights Team found there was a 30% uptake of job applications for any role offering these options. Its then Minister for Women and Equalities, Liz Truss, called for employers to make flexible working a standard option to help level up the UK, boost opportunities for women and reduce geographic inequality.

Invisible restrictions, such as the need to live close to the office in a city where the cost of renting is too high, or a gruelling daily commute, evaporate when remote working is an option. 

Parents with childcare commitments, home-based carers and people with disabilities are now on a much more level playing field. Age is less of a barrier. A tangibly youthful vibe in the office might once have disheartened a fifty-something job candidate, but virtual meetings help to showcase substance above appearance. So-called "silver workers" are a valuable resource (https://www.adeccogroup.com/future-of-work/latest-insights/silver-workers-pave-their-own-way-in-the-workforce/) both on their own merits and as a smart solution to talent scarcity. 

The numbers are compelling, too. 

16% of companies in the world (as at 2022) are now fully remote. (https://findstack.com/remote-work-statistics/)

3-10% is the average rise in productivity (https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-06-02/are-workers-more-productive-at-home) among remote employees.

19% higher innovation revenues (https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-and-where-diversity-drives-financial-performance) have been noted among diversely-staffed businesses.


 A promise, not a panacea
 
Savings at the employee end can be significant, another big factor in boosting diversity. Rail commuters can hang on to a hefty chunk of their salary when they no longer need to squeeze into rush hour carriages five days a week. Also, the cost of dressing for work shrinks to, well, the top half. In fact, estimated savings for remote workers in the US are around $7,000.(https://findstack.com/remote-work-statistics/)

Of course, for some - 16-24-year-olds in particular - escape is to the office, not from it. We have to remember that remote working is not a panacea. The three biggest challenges are unplugging after work (22%), loneliness (19%), and communication / collaboration (17%). (https://findstack.com/remote-work-statistics/)

But going by the statistics and the global conversation, remote and hybrid working is part of a new employment landscape, where equality and inclusivity sit on the horizon. It’s a CDO’s dream. While many obstacles remain between where we are today and a truly equitable workplace, the huge changes of the last two years should help give CDOs the tools and support they need to move us further towards that goal.

    What we now know about moving to a four-day week
                                   
Showing up to work five days a week is so ingrained it’s hard to imagine anything else - yet not working on Saturdays and Sundays is still a fairly recent invention. US carmaker Henry Ford popularised the shorter working week in the 1920s, and a new normal was born. But a century later, does the five-day or 40-hour week still work for us?

How the world is embracing the four-day week 
The United Arab Emirates adopted a four-and-a-half-day working week in 2021. Countless other countries - Spain, Scotland and Belgium among them - are trialling working fewer hours without dropping pay or productivity.

Many employers are ahead of the curve on this. In 2021, Atom bank became Britain’s largest company to adopt a four-day week, moving from 37 to 34 hours. When Toyota described in 2015 how it had shifted to a 30-hour week in Sweden, it had already been in place for 12 years.

The potential benefits can be profound. Toyota asked employees to work six hours a day but continued to pay them for eight - resulting in shorter customer waiting times, better productivity and low employee turnover. And when they built a new facility geared towards the six-hour day they were able to make it much smaller despite hiring more people, because the workforce was now spread across two shifts.

The reported benefits cascade further, from better employee mental health (and reduced absence) to a smaller carbon footprint and lower overheads. But there can be significant challenges to implementing a four-day week.

1. The financial costs of switching
When it concluded in 2017, a two-year trial involving 68 nurses at an old people’s home in Gothenburg was deemed too expensive to roll-out regionally. The experiment created jobs and reduced sick pay yet cost the city 12 million Kroner (£1.1m) in extra staff.

Not surprisingly, the cost implications vary by sector. At New Zealand finance company Perpetual Guardian, staff feedback identified a need for investment into remote work tech and automation (i.e., chat bots).

US company Wildbit moved to a permanent four-day week in 2017. They’ve invested in its success by paying staff to create remote environments suitable for deep focus and quality work. 

2. Productivity
Online coding school Treehouse started life in 2013 with the 32-hour week as standard. By 2016 they’d gone the other way - to a 40-hour week.

CEO Ryan Carson has explained why the four-day week didn’t work for Treehouse, saying ultimately it contributed to a reduced work ethic. This aligns with Perpetual Guardian, where managers found increased productivity depended on whether employees saw the new model as a privilege or a right.

3. Culture clash
It may sound counterintuitive, but not everyone wants more free time. Perpetual Guardian and Wildbit report some staff were uncomfortable with extra unstructured or alone time (Wildbit facilitates conversations about volunteering and hobbies to support this).

High demand and seasonal work can be a challenge, too, with some staff at Perpetual Guardian working compressed rather than fewer hours, i.e., gruelling 10-hour days.

Toyota’s responses include letting employees choose whether to work fewer hours, increasing the work force and introducing overlapping shifts. There are solutions – though they reveal the complexities of switching.

4. Doing things differently 
In Iceland, all public employees - from office workers to nurses and police – moved to shorter hours following years of large-scale testing. Reduced hours clearly can work across diverse sectors, but it means rethinking work priorities.

Meetings can be disruptive to deep work, not to mention time-heavy. Iceland ‘paid for’ its drop to 35 hours by pruning them back in favour of email.

Wildbit champions asynchronous communication (email, Slack and Basecamp), though they acknowledge the social risks of losing face-to-face contact. They also underline the duality of digital tools as both productivity and procrastination enablers: they have to be used with purpose to be effective.

Organisations also need to plan how reduced hours align with leave allowances and training sessions, and how or if colleagues communicate between shifts (some Icelandic employees said the need to contact colleagues ‘out of hours’ increased with fewer hours).

When Henry Ford embraced a shorter working week he foresaw its correlation to productivity. The near universal uptake of the five-day week as standard proves his instincts were right. So is the four-day week the next logical step? The many countries and companies thriving on shorter hours is a compelling signpost - and their candour about what works and doesn't work is a useful starting point for anyone considering following suit. But changing has very real consequences on the way businesses structure their staff and their interactions with each other and clients. These complexities should be considered properly.
