A video on research, opportunities and challenges.There have been a number of stories around nuclear fusion lately, with more predicted in the future. This would be a 60-second explainer video that we could reuse every time a new story broke (US spelling). Most interesting thing about fusion is how big the potential is in terms of energy output and how benign the waste issue is. Focus on this element rather than explaining how nuclear fusion works. Also mention how it's moved from government-backed research into start-ups, the private sector is getting involved. You can also use this article: ( https://www.ief.org/news/how-close-are-we-to-unlocking-the-limitless-energy-of-nuclear-fusion](https://www.ief.org/news/how-close-are-we-to-unlocking-the-limitless-energy-of-nuclear-fusion )  "},
